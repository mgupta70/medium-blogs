### 1. Object detection with Yolov8
Explains how one can develop their custom object detection model rather fairly quickly. I also highlighted potential errors one can make while training their own model.
### 2. Small Text identification using Transformer
(In Progress) We will see how standardised OCR libraries become difficult to adapt to very small text and needs lot of customization. To get around this, we will be training an EncoderDecoder Transformer. Just like 1st blog, I will make the process smooth where, finetuning this transformer will be easy-peasy.
